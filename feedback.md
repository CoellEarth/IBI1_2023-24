In the formative feedback, the sole problem I had is "have hard coded the pie chart data into your lists on lines 33 and 34".

I have change the code of week6 so that the pie chart change correspondingly with the value in the dictionart and display the data on the pie chart correspondingly

In the last practical, I had checked with Professor that I had fixed this problem.
